Bonus features/Changes
-EntityFramework
-Reflections when creating an instance, checking subclasses & object part of DbSet instead of hardcoding
-Custom evolutions (when adding a new pokemon, there it is not necessary to specify custom evolutions as if there's no evolution stated. 
If the pokemon is evolved without a stated evolution name, the evolution will be named "Evolved" + class name)
-Apart from merging/sacrifice evolution criteria, the selected pokemon must have 100exp or above to evolve
-HP and other stats will be multiplied by 2. This is changed for pokemon battle
-Pokemon battles where there's also statistics and also added. If your pokemon loses the battle, the pokemon will be deleted, if it wins it will 
be gained random amount of exp using random. Damage will be random with the ceiling damage (ATK stat) being the pokemon's damage. Critical damage will be shown 
if damage is higher than 70% of the ceiling damage.
-With the pokemon battle, the pokemon selected will fight with an enemy with a random skill, pokemon and stat
-ID is introduced for easier tracking of pokemons
-A menu to choose the pokemon is added (with the choice of pokemon depending on the reflections of it being a subclass of Pokemon + part of DbSet)
